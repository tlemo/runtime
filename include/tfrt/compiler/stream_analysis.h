// StreamAnalysis: Given an MLIR module in TFRT dialects and a cost_threshold as
// a module attribute, it produces stream assignment for each operations. The
// runtime can use this stream assignment as a hint for more efficient execution
// (eg. successive operations in the same stream can be executed inline).
//
// Cost Threshold: The cost threshold is used to decide whether to merge two
// streams. When there are independent streams, if the cost of a stream is
// smaller than this threshold, then it would be worth merging this stream with
// others, while if the cost is larger or equal to the threshold, then it is not
// worth doing so. Note that dependent streams can still be merged regardless of
// the cost. It is set through the module attribute `tfrt.cost_threshold`.
//
// The algorithm can be summarized as follows:
//
// 1. Build a naive stream tree where each stream contains only one operation:
//    1.1 Traverse the DAG in a topological order.
//    1.2 Create a stream for the current op.
//    1.3 Among streams that produce this opâ€™s operands, choose the one with the
//        largest cost from root as the parent. This is because it is likely the
//        path that triggers the op execution.
// 2. Try merging streams
//    2.1 Traverse the stream tree in post-order (which is also a reverse
//        topological order of the original DAG).
//    2.2 Merge children that are smaller than the cost threshold together until
//        exceeding the threshold. At this point, there is at most one child
//        left whose cost is smaller than the threshold. If there is, merge it
//        with the current stream
//    2.3 Choose the child with the highest cost and merge it with the current
//        stream.
//
